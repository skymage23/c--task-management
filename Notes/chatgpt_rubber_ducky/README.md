I'm trying out using ChatGPT as my "rubber ducky" for
rubber ducky development (explain your design to
a rubber ducky out loud, and if it stills makes 
sense to you when you do so, you are probably
on the right track).

Rubber ducky development is a great way to help
catch problems with your design before committing to it.

Using ChatGPT for this carries the bonus that it
will use its knowledge base to help you in your
design or to nudge you in another direction that
other developers took when in your position,
although you need to be explicit about your
development requirements for ChatGPT to better
give you a working answer that will
better fit your needs.
