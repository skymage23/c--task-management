I'm going to need to craft my own convolutional neural network (CNN).

For my inventory app project, it may do me good to hire a 3D modeling artist to create
3D models of example network closets that I can import into Unreal Engine and use to simulate
my app's intended usecase.

I will also need a model of an example floor with various rooms and a network closet,
and that said model follows a floor plan designed by myself.

Honestly, it'd be better to have a "random dungeon generator" (think Mementos from Persona 5).
That way, we can run it and generate thousands of training and validation examples
to refine our geographic guidance algorithms.

Perhaps we can also leverage a GPS chip to map longitude and latitude coordinates to a registered building address.
That way, we can dynamically detect what building the user is in and be able to fetch the address using that information.
Some of our records inventory require tracking the address of the building where the item is located. 
That's where this feature will be useful.

Also, how can we adapt to NOT having a floor plan.
